# Multi-layer_NetViz

Multi-layer_NetViz is a lightweight Python toolkit for visualizing and analyzing multi-layer networks, with a focus on social and cascade networks. This repository provides tools to explore the relationships between two interconnected layers, such as users and topics, using advanced network visualization techniques.

## Features

- **Multi-layer network visualization**: Display multiple interconnected graphs (e.g., users and topics) in a single 3D plot.
- **Customizable layouts**: Node positions are computed using a combination of spring layouts and alignment matrices.
- **Node and edge annotations**: Nodes and edges can be labeled and colored based on network properties.
- **Interactive plotting**: Uses `matplotlib` with widget support for interactive exploration.
## Main Components

### Notebook: `Visu_network_clean.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the visualization workflow:

1. **Data Loading**: Loads network parameters and adjacency matrices from a pickle file.
2. **Graph Construction**: Builds two graphs (`g1` and `g2`) representing different layers (e.g., users and topics).
3. **Node Alignment & Coloring**: Computes node alignments and colors based on network statistics.
4. **Layout Calculation**: Generates node positions using a convex combination of spring layouts and alignment matrices.
5. **Visualization**: Plots the bi-layer network in 3D using the `LayeredNetworkGraph` function from `bi_layer_NetViz_fcts.py`.

### Module: `bi_layer_NetViz_fcts.py`

This Python module contains core functions for:

- Computing node colors and alignments.
- Defining custom node markers.
- Rendering layered network graphs with advanced visualization options.

## Getting Started

**Just run the notebook!**
  - This visualization tool is used via a notebook for a more didactical approach of the components, making it easier to understand the workflow.
  - Open `Visu_network_clean.ipynb` in Jupyter and execute the cells to visualize your bi-layer network.

## Example
The data included in this repository consists of social network users sharing tweets that contain url shortening services.
The notebook visualizes two layers:
- **Users (`W`)**: Social network users with their friendship networks and connections to url shortening services.
- **Topics (`T`)**: Topics represented by url shortening services, showing how users interact with them, as well as the interactions between these labeled types of content.
Edges and node sizes/colors reflect relationships and activity between layers.
